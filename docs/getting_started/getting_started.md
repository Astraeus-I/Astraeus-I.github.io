# ðŸš€ Getting Started

In this section, we will cover the basics of getting started with installing libhal on your machine and flashing the Astraeus-I board. We will also cover how to create your own project.

### <img src="../../assets/libhal.png" style="width: 30px; height: auto;"> Libhal Introduction

Libhal is a software library designed to abstract complexities associated with interfacing with different hardware platforms. By offering a unified API, libhal enables developers to write software that's independent of the underlying hardware specifics. This allows for seamless portability across different platforms, ensuring that the same code can be used to run on different processors, mircrocontrollers, systems, and devices. Libhal is designed to be modular and extensible. This allows developers to add support for new hardware platforms and devices.

To learn more on the installation process, please visit the <a href="https://libhal.github.io/2.2/getting_started/" target="_blank">libhal docs</a>
 to learn how to install and configure libhal on your machine, including all the prerequities below . Make sure you go through all of the steps in the docs before continuing. This includes installing and flashing to your Astraeus-I board.

## ðŸ§° Installing Dependencies

## ðŸ§± Creating Your Own Project

Start by cloning `libhal-starter`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libhal/libhal-starter.git
```

Take a look at the `README.md` of
[libhal/libhal-starter](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-starter) to get
details about how to modify the starter project and make it work for your needs.

!!! note
    You can learn more about libhal by reading the <a href="https://libhal.github.io/2.2/user_guide/fundamentals/" target="_blank">User Guide</a> and <a href="https://libhal.github.io/2.2/api/namespaces/" target="_blank">API Reference</a>


## ðŸ”“ Full Modularity

Astraeus-I boasts a fully modular design, offering unparalleled flexibility to its users. This means that individuals can effortlessly customize their setup by adding new devices or swapping out existing ones based on their evolving requirements. Such a design ensures that the board remains adaptable and future-proof, accommodating both current needs and potential future expansions. Whether you're aiming to integrate the latest devices or reconfigure your setup for a specific application, the Astraeus-I board's modular architecture empowers you to do so with ease and efficiency.

### ðŸ”¨ Adding Tools

If you'd like to add a device or tool to your project you can do so by adding it to the conanfile.py file. You can find the conanfile.py file in the root directory of your project. The conanfile.py file is used to specify the dependencies of your project. To add a device or tool to your project you will need to add it to the `requirements` list in the conanfile.py file. For example, if you want to add the telemetry recorder tool to your project you would add it to the `requirements` list like this:

```python
def requirements(self):
    if str(self.options.platform).startswith("lpc40"):
        self.requires("libhal-lpc40/[^2.1.1]")
    self.requires("telemetry-recorder/0.0.1")
    self.requires("libhal-util/[^3.0.0]")
```
