# ðŸš€ Getting Started

In this section, we will cover the basics of getting started with installing libhal and astraeus packages on your machine and flashing the Astraeus-I board. We will also cover how to create your own project.

### ðŸ§° Installing Dependencies

**Libhal** is a software library designed to abstract complexities associated with interfacing with different hardware platforms. By offering a unified API, libhal enables developers to write software that's independent of the underlying hardware specifics. This allows for seamless portability across different platforms, ensuring that the same code can be used to run on different processors, mircrocontrollers, systems, and devices. Libhal is designed to be modular and extensible. This allows developers to add support for new hardware platforms and devices.

**Astraeus** is a collection of packages that are built on top of libhal. These packages are designed to be used with the Astraeus-I board.
