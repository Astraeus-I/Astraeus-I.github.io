## Abstract
The Astraeus-Library is a curated collection of software packages, initially designed for the Astraeus-I board but with an ambitious vision that extends into avionic systems. At its core is libhal, a library that demystifies the complexity of hardware interfaces. Through libhal's unified API, we guarantee software portability across an expansive range of hardware platforms, enabling the same code to seamlessly operate on various processors and devices. This is especially crucial in the avionics sector, where reliability and adaptability are paramount.

Our commitment to modular design in libhal not only facilitates current hardware integration but also lays the groundwork for future expansions. As we develop new boards specifically for avionics and other specialized applications, the Astraeus-Library evolves, becoming an increasingly versatile tool for developers. This forward-thinking approach ensures that the Astraeus-Library remains at the forefront of cross-platform compatibility and innovation, ready to meet both today's needs and tomorrow's challenges.

## Our Design Philosophy
Astraeus-Library embodies a unique design philosophy centered on the following pillars:

1. **Modularity:** Crafted to accommodate various avionic needs through its adaptable and interchangeable modules.
2. **Lightweight:** Engineered with precision to offer a lightweight yet robust solution for diverse avionic applications.
3. **High Performance:** Designed for optimum functionality, Astraeus-Library delivers superior performance, making it ideal for a wide range of avionic applications.
4. **User-Friendly:** With an intuitive interface and straightforward integration process, Astraeus-Library is accessible and easy to use, even for individuals who are not tech-savvy.

## The Basics
Astraeus-Library seamlessly integrates interfaces with hardware devices and peripherals through effective use of runtime polymorphism. This technique allows for clear separation between application logic and driver implementation, ensuring smooth operation on platforms with the necessary components, emphasizing its versatility and compatibility.
