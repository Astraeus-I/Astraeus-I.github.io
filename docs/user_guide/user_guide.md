## üß± Fundamentals of Astraeus-I
The Astraeus-I board is ingeniously crafted for high modularity in both hardware and software, making it an ideal choice for avionic system applications. Its standout feature is the micromod - a compact and interchangeable microprocessor board that allows you to customize the microcontroller according to your project requirements. The board comes equipped with a variety of sensors and peripherals, enhancing its utility and versatility. These include:

- A sophisticated 9 Degrees of Freedom IMU (ICM-20948)
- A highly accurate Barometer (MPL3115A2)
- A dependable GPS module (Neo-m9n)
- An SD Card slot for convenient data storage

In terms of software, the Astraeus-I boasts a comprehensive suite, including specific device drivers for each onboard component. These drivers are integral to the functionality of the telemetry recorder and the board application package. The telemetry recorder is adept at capturing data from the onboard devices, offering the flexibility to store this data on the SD card or, if equipped, to transmit it via a radio module. While the board doesn't come with an Xbee radio module, it's designed to accommodate one should you choose to enhance its capabilities - a possibility you can explore further in the order form. The board application package is another significant feature, enabling the running of custom applications on the board. This allows for precise control over the onboard devices and the execution of customized actions, providing a robust platform for developing tailored applications.

## üî© Hardware Details

To connect the Astraeus-I board with other devices, start by referencing the pinout diagram or the clearly labeled pins on the board itself. This will guide you in identifying the exact pins required for your connection. Once you have this information, match these pins with the corresponding ones on the device you're connecting to, using its pinout diagram as a reference. The Astraeus-I board is equipped with a variety of features including a 9 DOF IMU (ICM-20948), a Barometer (MPL3115A2), GPS (Neo-m9n), an SD Card slot, and it even supports the installation of an xbee radio module. Another key feature of this board is its micromod connector, which allows for easy swapping of the microcontroller, adding a layer of versatility to your projects.

üöß Under construction üöß

The Astraeus-I board is equipped with two Qwiic connectors, designed to facilitate effortless integration of additional device modules. This feature not only allows for straightforward singular module attachments but also supports daisy chaining, letting users link multiple modules in sequence. This capability ensures scalable expansions, enabling users to customize and augment the board's functionalities as per their requirements. Whether you're aiming for simple additions or building a more intricate system requring additional sensors, the Qwiic connectors on the Astraeus-I board make the process seamless and user-friendly.

### üî® Adding Tools

If you'd like to add a device or tool to your project you can do so by adding it to the conanfile.py file. You can find the conanfile.py file in the root directory of your project. The conanfile.py file is used to specify the dependencies of your project. To add a device or tool to your project you will need to add it to the `requirements` list in the conanfile.py file. For example, if you want to add the telemetry recorder tool to your project you would add it to the `requirements` list like this:

```python
def requirements(self):
    if str(self.options.platform).startswith("lpc40"):
        self.requires("libhal-lpc40/[^2.1.1]")
    self.requires("telemetry-recorder/0.0.1")
    self.requires("libhal-util/[^3.0.0]")
