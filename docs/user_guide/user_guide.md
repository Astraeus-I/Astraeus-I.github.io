# ðŸ“– User Guide
The Astraeus-I board is built to be modular in hardware and software. It includes a micromod which is a small micropressor board that can be switched out to the microcontroller of your choice. The board also includes a variety of sensors and peripherals that can be used for a variety of applications designed for avionic systems. The onboard devices include:

- 9 DOF IMU (ICM-20948)
- Barometer (MPL3115A2)
- GPS (Neo-m9n)
- SD Card

The boards software comprises of device drivers for each of the onboard devices, a telemetry recorder, and a board application package. The device drivers are used to interface with the onboard devices and are used by the telemetry recorder and board application package. The telemetry recorder is a tool used to record data from the onboard devices and either store it in the sd card or transmit the data if the board has a radio module installed. The board application package is used to run a custom application on the board. The application can be used to control the onboard devices and perform custom actions which you can use to build your own application.

## ðŸ”Œ Wiring to other Devices
ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§

To wire the board to other devices, you can use the pinout diagram or the pin labels on the Astraeus-I board to find the pins you need to connect to. Then you will need to use the pinout diagram for the device you are connecting to and connect the pins to the corresponding pins on the device.
