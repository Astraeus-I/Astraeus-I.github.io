# ðŸ§± Fundamentals of Astraeus-I
The Astraeus-I board is ingeniously crafted for high modularity in both hardware and software, making it an ideal choice for avionic system applications. Its standout feature is the micromod - a compact and interchangeable microprocessor board that allows you to customize the microcontroller according to your project requirements. The board comes equipped with a variety of sensors and peripherals, enhancing its utility and versatility. These include:

- A sophisticated 9 Degrees of Freedom IMU (ICM-20948)
- A highly accurate Barometer (MPL3115A2)
- A dependable GPS module (Neo-m9n)
- An SD Card slot for convenient data storage

In terms of software, the Astraeus-I boasts a comprehensive suite, including specific device drivers for each onboard component. These drivers are integral to the functionality of the telemetry recorder and the board application package. The telemetry recorder is adept at capturing data from the onboard devices, offering the flexibility to store this data on the SD card or, if equipped, to transmit it via a radio module. While the board doesn't come with an Xbee radio module, it's designed to accommodate one should you choose to enhance its capabilities - a possibility you can explore further in the order form. The board application package is another significant feature, enabling the running of custom applications on the board. This allows for precise control over the onboard devices and the execution of customized actions, providing a robust platform for developing tailored applications.
