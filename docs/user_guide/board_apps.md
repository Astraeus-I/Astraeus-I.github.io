The board application package is used to run a custom application on the board. The application can be used to control the onboard devices and perform custom actions which you can use to build your own application.

### ðŸ“¡ Telemetry Recorder

The Telemetry Recorder is a vital tool for capturing data from devices on the Astraeus-I board. It allows users to either save data directly to an SD card or transmit it through a radio module, provided the board is equipped with one. This dual functionality enables both immediate data transmission for real-time monitoring and secure data storage for later analysis.

To understand the Telemetry Recorderâ€™s features and operation better, visit the projectâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/Astraeus-I/telemetry-recorder" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>. Here, youâ€™ll find detailed documentation and resources to guide you through installation and usage. The repository also serves as a platform for collaboration, issue reporting, and community engagement to improve and develop the tool further. Whether you're a researcher, technician, or hobbyist, the Telemetry Recorder is a valuable asset for efficient data recording and transmission with the Astraeus-I board.
