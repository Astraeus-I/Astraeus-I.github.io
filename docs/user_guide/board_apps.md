# ðŸ§© Board Application Tools
The board application tools for the Astraeus-I board comprise a suite of software resources that empower users to develop and run their own custom applications. These tools provide the means to effectively control and manipulate the board's onboard devices, enabling a wide range of customized actions. Central to this toolkit is the libhal library, which forms the foundation by offering a comprehensive set of device drivers specifically for these onboard components.

Designed with modularity in mind, these tools offer the flexibility to seamlessly integrate user-created applications onto the board. This design approach not only enhances usability but also encourages innovation and personalization. Additionally, the board application tools are crafted for portability, ensuring compatibility across various operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. This cross-platform functionality ensures that users have the freedom and convenience to develop and deploy their applications in diverse computing environments.

### ðŸ“¡ Telemetry Recorder

The Telemetry Recorder is a vital tool for capturing data from devices on the Astraeus-I board. It allows users to either save data directly to an SD card or transmit it through a radio module, provided the board is equipped with one. This dual functionality enables both immediate data transmission for real-time monitoring and secure data storage for later analysis.
