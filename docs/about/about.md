# ðŸ“° About The Project
Astraeus-I originated as a senior project at San Jose State University, collaboratively developed over two semesters by a dedicated team of three students. This initiative was divided into two pivotal phases, with the initial semester focusing primarily on crafting the hardware, followed by a subsequent semester dedicated to the software development aspect.

During the course of its inception, our team had the opportunity to work closely with libhal, a collaborative effort that significantly contributed to the success and refinement of the project. This partnership was instrumental in navigating through the complexities and challenges that emerged during the development process, providing valuable insights and support that shaped Astraeus-I into its current form.

## Project Phases
Hardware Development Phase: The first semester of the project was devoted to the intricate process of hardware development. This phase entailed rigorous research, planning, and implementation to construct a robust hardware foundation for Astraeus-I, ensuring its reliability and efficiency in performing its designated functions.

## Software Development Phase
With a solid hardware base in place, the second semester was utilized for software development. This crucial phase involved coding, testing, and refining the software components to work seamlessly with the developed hardware, ultimately creating a cohesive and functional system.

## Collaborative Effort
Engaging with libhal during the development process enriched our project with a wealth of knowledge and expertise in the field. Their consistent support and guidance played a pivotal role in overcoming technical hurdles and implementing best practices, resulting in a project outcome that not only met but exceeded our initial expectations.
