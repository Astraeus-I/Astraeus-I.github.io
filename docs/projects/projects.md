## 🛩️ Astraeus Corsair Cruiser
This project was created by the developers of the Astraeus-I board. The Astraeus Corsair Cruiser is corsair model airplane and its purpose was to have a fun side project while we were developing the board. It has all of the built in sensors on the board that controls the airplanes systems for either manual or autonomous control. It also has a built in camera that can be used for FPV flying so we can see what the plane sees.

The Plane was built using the <a href="https://store.flitetest.com/ft-master-series-corsair-mkr2/" target="_blank">Flight Test Corsair Kit</a> while watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRgKW__by2c" target="_blank">Video</a> for assembly. Overall this was a very fun project and we are looking forward to flying it more in the future.
